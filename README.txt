## Scope
The function of the calculator application is to do the defined basic functions of a calculator. The basic functions are as follows:

	Add
	Subtract
	Multiply
	Divide

The calculator needs to be able to have as many inputs as the user wants before finalizing the equation. The program only needs to do the equation that’s set before the equals. We will not be recalling information from previous sessions or even from the last equation that was given.

We will be implementing a graphic interface that only allows for numerical values. This interface will also include the predefined functions as well as an equals sign to let the program know we are finished inputting values.
(UPDATE 2024-09-05: this program will only be used in the terminal and will not include a GUI)

## Potential User Errors
Users find unique and creative ways to break applications. This is why are implementing the graphical UI to avoid any confusion on what is an available input. I (Noah Gruhlke) am not currently capable of creating a UI element, but I am willing to learn and adapt. I will make this interface and gain the knowledge needed to finish this program.


## Handling Exceptions
There will be a class specifically designed for handling errors. When a new bug is found, it will be added to this error handling class and be worked on as time allows.


## Steps of Development

- Create a functioning concept within the console window 
	- no need to get fancy; get it to work as if the user knows what they are doing
	- Create Classes:
		- Handle the values (could be any number)
		- Handle different math steps
			- adding 
			- Subtracting
			- Multiply
			- Divide
		- Handle giving the user the correct answer
		- Create the Exception Catches
	- How would a user break this?
	- Try to break the application
	- Bring to mentor for Review

Constraints
All code needs to be made from concepts I know and understand.
If code is found from another source other than my personal database, I must fully understand what it is doing.
No using AI to create code.
